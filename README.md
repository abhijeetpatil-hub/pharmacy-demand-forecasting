# Pharmacy Demand Forecasting 📊💊

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting medicine demand for a pharmacy** using historical sales data. The goal is to help pharmacies **avoid stock-outs, reduce overstocking, and improve inventory planning** using data-driven insights.

The project covers the **complete data analytics lifecycle**:

* Data creation & cleaning (Python)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Demand forecasting using Machine Learning
* Business dashboard using **Power BI**
* Version control using **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Pharmacies often face issues like:

* Medicines going out of stock
* Excess inventory causing expiry losses
* Poor visibility of future demand

### ✅ Solution

Using historical sales data, we predict **next 30 days medicine demand** so that pharmacies can:

* Order optimal stock
* Reduce losses
* Improve customer satisfaction

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Power BI** (Interactive dashboard)
* **Git & GitHub** (Version control)
